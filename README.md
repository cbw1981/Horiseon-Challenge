# <Horiseon-Challenge>

## Description
The goal of this project is to provide necessary changes to the starter code in order to make the code more accessible via the addition of HTML semantics and the consoldation of the attached Cascading Style Sheets. Alternative text and comments were also added to the CSS to accomodate screen readers and to assist any developers in future implementations of the code.
